# Frontend Mentor - Testimonials grid section solution

This is a solution to the [Testimonials grid section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.



## Overview

In this challenge I used grid-template-areas for the first time, and I found it quite useful, however for templates where there ary many rows or columns I would still use
grid-template-rows/columns.
